Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder characterized by fat 
accumulation in hepatocytes among individuals with minimal or no alcohol consumption. 
It is closely linked to metabolic syndrome, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. 
NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can 
progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even liver cancer. The disease is largely asymptomatic 
in its early stages, making early detection crucial for effective management. 
To address this, a predictive application was developed using machine learning algorithms 
to estimate NAFLD risk. The system enables users, including healthcare professionals and 
patients, to input relevant health data for risk assessment. Various algorithms were explored 
to optimize predictive accuracy, which are: ùëò-Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector 
Machine, Random Forest, XGBoost and Bayesian Network. The methodology involved 
data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and cross-validated hyperparameter 
tuning to ensure robust performance.
